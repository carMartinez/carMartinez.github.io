<p>
Thanks for checking out my website. Here I showcase some projects typically
relating to machine learning, signal processing, and the relevant math. Source code
via <a href="https://github.com/carMartinez">my GitHub</a> is typically linked
with all posts.

I got started with machine learning later in my undergradate math career at NYU.
On top of that, I did research for the Kirchhoff Lab at NYU Langone Medical Center
under <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/tomas-kirchhoff">Dr. Tomas Kirchhoff</a>
for a few years where I was responsible for bioinformatic and statistical pipelines
to process and analyze large volumes of genetic data on high-performance computing clusters. More
recently, I finished a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering at
Georgia Tech while taking classes primarily in signal processing and machine learning.
