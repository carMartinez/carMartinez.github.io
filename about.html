<p>
Thanks for checking out my website. Here I showcase some projects typically
relating to machine learning, signal processing, and the relevant math. Source code
via my GitHub is linked with all projects.

I got started with machine learning later in my undergradate math career at NYU.
On top of that, I did research for the Kirchhoff Lab at NYU Langone Medical Center
for a few years where I was responsible for statistical and bioinformatic pipelines
to process large volumes of genetic data on high-performance computing clusters. More
recently, I finished a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering at
Georgia Tech and took classes primarily in signal processing and machine learning.
