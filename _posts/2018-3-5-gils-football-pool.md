A website for streamlining my Dad's yearly Super Bowl pool/squares game. Built
with Django, the site utilizes a postgresql database to organize and manage all
of our friends who want to play. Players simply pick their squares and enter
their name and contact info. This saves dozens of hours my dad previously
spent manually updating spreadsheets, distributing them in person or by email,
and figuring out how to contact people.
